# Credit-EDA-in-Python
This project focuses on Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) for credit-related datasets using Python. The primary aim is to explore and analyze credit customer data to uncover patterns, trends, and risk factors that can influence decision-making in areas like credit approvals, fraud detection, and loan default prediction. By applying data cleaning, statistical analysis, and visualization techniques, we can better understand how various factors such as income, age, credit score, and payment history affect creditworthiness.

🎯 Objectives
Understand the structure and quality of the dataset.

Identify missing values and handle them appropriately.

Analyze distributions of numerical and categorical variables.

Detect patterns and correlations among variables.

Provide insights for better decision-making in credit risk management.

📂 Dataset
Name: credit_data.csv (or your dataset name)

Source: (Mention source: e.g., Kaggle, UCI Repository, or company dataset)

Description: Contains customer information such as age, income, credit score, loan amount, payment history, etc.

Sample Columns:

Customer_ID

Age

Gender

Income

Credit_Score

Loan_Amount

Payment_History

Default_Flag

🛠 Tools & Libraries Used
Python

Pandas – Data manipulation

NumPy – Numerical operations

Matplotlib – Data visualization

Seaborn – Advanced visualizations

Plotly (optional) – Interactive charts

Jupyter Notebook – Development environment

🔍 EDA Steps
Data Loading – Read dataset into Python environment.

Data Cleaning – Handle missing values, duplicates, and outliers.

Descriptive Statistics – Summarize numerical and categorical data.

Univariate Analysis – Distribution of individual variables.

Bivariate Analysis – Relationships between variables.

Correlation Analysis – Identify relationships between numerical features.

Visualization – Histograms, bar charts, scatter plots, heatmaps, etc.

Insights & Conclusion – Summarize findings.

📊 Key Insights (Example)
Customers with low credit scores and high debt-to-income ratios are more likely to default.

Younger customers tend to have smaller loan amounts but higher default rates.

Payment history strongly correlates with the probability of default.
